config CPU_FREQ
	bool "CPU Frequency scaling"
	help
	  CPU Frequency scaling allows you to change the clock speed of 
	  CPUs on the fly. This is a nice method to save power, because 
	  the lower the CPU clock speed, the less power the CPU consumes.

	  Note that this driver doesn't automatically change the CPU
	  clock speed, you need to either enable a dynamic cpufreq governor
	  (see below) after boot, or use a userspace tool.

	  For details, take a look at <file:Documentation/cpu-freq>.

	  If in doubt, say N.

config MODULE_CPU_FREQ
	bool "Intel module level cpu frequency scaling"
	help
	  This option enables CPU frequency scaling to happen at module level on Intel
	  processor based systems. This is useful on systems that have more than one
	  cpu per module.

	  If in doubt, say N

config CPU_FREQ_STAT
	tristate "CPU frequency translation statistics"
	select CPU_FREQ_TABLE
	default y
	help
	  This driver exports CPU frequency statistics information through sysfs
	  file system.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called cpufreq_stats.

	  If in doubt, say N.

config CPU_FREQ_STAT_DETAILS
	bool "CPU frequency translation statistics details"
	depends on CPU_FREQ_STAT
	help
	  This will show detail CPU frequency translation table in sysfs file
	  system.

	  If in doubt, say N.

config GENERIC_CPUFREQ_CPU0

	select CPU_FREQ_TABLE
	help
	  This adds a generic cpufreq driver for CPU0 frequency management.
	  It supports both uniprocessor (UP) and symmetric multiprocessor (SMP)
	  systems which share clock and voltage across all CPUs.

	  If in doubt, say N.

	help
	  This adds the cpufreq driver for SuperH. Any CPU that supports
	  clock rate rounding through the clock framework can use this
	  driver. While it will make the kernel slightly larger, this is
	  harmless for CPUs that don't support rate rounding. The driver
	  will also generate a notice in the boot log before disabling
	  itself if the CPU in question is not capable of rate rounding.

	  For details, take a look at <file:Documentation/cpu-freq>.
